## Common usage

Each time a milestone is closed, this GitHub action scans its attached issues and pull request, and automatically generates a wonderful release note.  

_The action uses [Spring.io release-notes generator](https://github.com/spring-io/github-release-notes-generator) tool._

## Why?

Why aren't we simply automating the release creation and push the release notes there?  
We think in some cases it is better to keep release notes separated from the release process... yeah, maybe the right name is not release notes anymore. :) Taking as example a continuous deployment project: __anytime you push to the repository, a new version of the application is built and pushed in production.__ And so, a new release is created to complete the process; a release with a **single** feature inside.  
We think it is not a good idea to push to 'users' a new release notes message every time you generate a changes in the source code (let us say 10 times a day?).  
It may be a better way to communicate only once every week or once the sprint is over, which gives you a clearer and complete release notes containing the aggregated information pushed in production within the last sprint (or any days).

## Breaking change

Starting from August 2019, GitHub team switch [Actions syntax from HCL to YAML](https://help.github.com/en/articles/migrating-github-actions-from-hcl-syntax-to-yaml-syntax).  
The previous syntax will no longer be supported by GitHub on September 30, 2019.

As a consequence, __please use v2.0.0+__ release and note that __all v1.x.x are deprecated__ and will no longer work on September 30, 2019.


## Startup

### Use Github action

#### Settings for v1.0.0+ release (deprecated)

The usage is really simple, you just need to add the Action reference in your GitHub workflow.

```
workflow "On Milestone" {
  on = "milestone"
  resolves = ["Create Release Notes"]
}

action "Create Release Notes" {
  uses = "Decathlon/release-notes-generator-action@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
```

#### Settings for v2.0.0+ release

Create a file into your root project directory: `.github/workflows/labeler.yml`:
```yaml
# Trigger the workflow on milestone events
on: milestone
name: Milestone Closure
jobs:
  action-filter:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: action-filter
      uses: actions/bin/filter@master
      with:
        # We filter on closing (milestone) action
        args: action closed
    - name: Create Release Notes
      uses: docker://decathlon/release-notes-generator-action:2.0.0
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        OUTPUT_FOLDER: temp_release_notes
        USE_MILESTONE_TITLE: "true"
```

#### NOTE
It is important to add the *GITHUB_TOKEN* secret because the action needs to access to your repository Milestone/Issues information using the GitHub API.

As we filtered on *milestone* the action will execute anytime an event occurs on your repository milestones.

The action is then filtered on *closed* events. All other events on the milestones will only log an action execution but the release notes won't be created.

### SUCCEEDED Create Release Notes 14:26:07Z (26.262s)
```

### Configure output folder
By default the release file is created into the Docker home folder. If you want you can specify a custom folder for your file creation via the `OUTPUT_FOLDER` environment variable.

### Custom output release file
By default the output is created into *release_file.md* file. You can control the output name using environment variables in your action.

#### Prefixed name using v1.0.0+
Providing the `FILENAME_PREFIX` environment variable, you can control the output file name which will have the provided prefix name with the milestone id.

```
action "Create Release Notes" {
  uses = "docker://decathlon/release-notes-generator-action:1.0.0"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
  env = {
    FILENAME_PREFIX = "MyMilestone"
  }
}
```

#### Prefixed name using v2.0.0+
```YAML
- name: Create Release Notes
  uses: docker://decathlon/release-notes-generator-action:2.0.0
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    FILENAME_PREFIX: MyMilestone
```

The output filename will be `MyMilestone_2` (if the milestone id is 2).

### Use Milestone title
Providing the `USE_MILESTONE_TITLE` environment variable which allow you to switch the name to the Milestone title instead of providing a *static* one.
The title will be modified replacing spaces with underscore '_' char.

#### Prefixed name using v1.0.0+

```
action "Create Release Notes" {
  uses = "Decathlon/release-notes-generator-action@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
  env = {
    USE_MILESTONE_TITLE = true
  }
}
```

#### Prefixed name using v2.0.0+

```YAML
- name: Create Release Notes
  uses: docker://decathlon/release-notes-generator-action:2.0.0
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    USE_MILESTONE_TITLE: "true"
```

#### Result illustration
```console
[...]

### SUCCEEDED Create Release Notes 15:53:53Z (15.913s)
```

## How to use the generated file
The idea is to keep the control about what to do with the release notes file.  
So simply link a new action and: send it by mail, push it on your website, on the github wiki, ...

Personally, in some of our projects, we are pushing the release note as new GitHub wiki page using the [Wiki page creator action](https://github.com/Decathlon/wiki-page-creator-action).
